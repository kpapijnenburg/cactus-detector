# Cactus Detector
## Introduction
During the minor Applied Data Science given by Fontys Hogescholen ICT I created an application for detection whether an image contains a cactus or not. In this repository the files for this application can be found.

## Models
For the challenge I will develop multiple models and compare the results of them. Below of list of the models can be found together with a short description.

- CNN-V1; Base model Convolutional network to compare optimized models to.
- CNN-V2; VGG Style model.

The models weights and settings will be stored in the ```models``` folder.
